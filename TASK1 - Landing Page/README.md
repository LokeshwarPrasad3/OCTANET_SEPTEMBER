## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the landing page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the landing page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the landing page.
- `images/`: A directory containing images used in the landing page.

## How to Run

To view and test the landing page locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the root directory "OCTANET_SEPTEMBER" in VS Code.

4. Right-click on the "index.html" file and select "Open with Live Server." If you haven't already installed the Live Server extension for VS Code, you can install it from the Visual Studio Code Extensions section.

5. Your default web browser will open, and the landing page will be displayed.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed for your task. Happy coding!
