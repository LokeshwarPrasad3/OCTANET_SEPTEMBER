## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the ToDo app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the ToDo app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the ToDo app functionality.
- `Images/`: A directory containing some images used in the app (if applicable).

## How to Run

To run the ToDo app locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open the root directory "taks2" in VS Code.

4. Right-click on the "index.html" file and select "Open with Live Server." If you haven't already installed the Live Server extension for VS Code, you can install it from the Visual Studio Code Extensions section.

5. Your default web browser will open, and the ToDo app will be displayed.

6. Interact with the ToDo app, add tasks, mark them as complete, and explore its functionality.

7. Feel free to modify and enhance the code as needed for your internship task.

## Live Demo

You can also access a live demo of the ToDo app by following this link: [ToDo App Live Demo](https://todo-list-lokeshwar.netlify.app/)

Feel free to use the live demo to see the app in action without setting it up locally.

Happy coding!
